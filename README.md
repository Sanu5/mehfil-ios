# Mehfil · iOS

Operations app for Indian wedding-service vendors — decorators, caterers, photographers, light-and-sound crews. The calendar is the spine, outstanding money is always one tap away, and double-bookings surface before they become a problem.

Built in **SwiftUI for iOS 26 with Liquid Glass**, from the Figma design
[Mehfil](https://www.figma.com/design/HiKVpYsO9qLnUAWF1iZrUY/Untitled?node-id=3-2): 24 screens, 18 components, light and dark. Accounts and data live in **Firebase** (Sign in with Apple, Google, Cloud Firestore) — the rules and data model are in the sibling repo `mehfil-backend`; the Android app is `mehfil-android`.

## What it does

| Flow | Screens |
|---|---|
| **A · Season view** | Home with the conflict banner, outstanding receivables and the event that needs attention · Calendar month with event dots and conflict dates · Day timeline where overlapping events sit side by side · Season summary against target |
| **B · Events** | Segmented list grouped by month · Event hub with summary tiles, collapsible Payments, Crew, Inventory and Runsheet · Two-step create with an inline conflict check the moment a date is picked · Runsheet with completion toggles and reorder · Change request that shows consequences (chairs, tables, helpers, transport) and the revised quote |
| **C · Money** | Receivables grouped Overdue → Due this week → Upcoming · Per-event payment schedule with collection progress · Record payment on a large numeric keypad (never the alphanumeric keyboard) · Reminders with real composed copy in three tones and the history of what was sent before · Expenses with the margin and a loss state |
| **D · Team & inventory** | Crew by role with availability for a chosen date · Assign crew where booked members stay tappable and open a comparison of both events · Attendance with a single-tap three-state control · Inventory with commitment bars and over-committed items first · Item detail with a 30-day commitment strip |
| **E · Clients & system** | Client list with lifetime value and repeat markers · The client-facing shared event page (cream, gradient mesh, always light, ShareLink) · Enquiry intake that saves, edits, closes and converts to an event · Package templates · Profile with business details, payment details, notifications, appearance · Account with sample data, erase, sign out and account deletion |
| **Sign-in & data** | Welcome with Sign in with Apple, Google, or a mobile number + OTP · Mobile numbers are only saved once a one-time code has confirmed them (linked to the account, so the same person can sign in by phone later) · One-screen business onboarding with an optional sample season · Every record (events, clients, milestones, crew, attendance, inventory, runsheet, reminders, expenses, enquiries, packages, change requests) is a Firestore document under `vendors/{uid}`, cached offline and streamed live |

Every amount uses Indian digit grouping (`₹23,47,500`), every screen that modifies data writes through the store and shows a save state, and the event draft survives leaving the create flow. Overdue milestones, crew conflicts, payment states and season totals are **derived on the device from stored data**, never stored, so they can't go stale.

## Liquid Glass

- System tab bar through the `Tab` API; it minimises on scroll down and hides on pushed screens.
- Glass toolbar and back buttons; `.buttonStyle(.glass)` header actions on tab roots and a `.glassProminent` "New event" action.
- `.glassEffect()` on the toast, the running-total strip above "Create event", and the title chip that floats in when a root screen scrolls.
- Docked primary actions use `safeAreaBar`, so content scrolls under them with the soft edge effect.
- On the shared event page the glass controls pick up the mesh behind them.

## Run it

Requires Xcode 26 (iOS 26 SDK). Open `Mehfil.xcodeproj`, pick the **Mehfil** scheme and an iPhone simulator, and run. Swift packages (`firebase-ios-sdk`, `GoogleSignIn-iOS`) resolve on first open. From the terminal:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Mehfil.xcodeproj -scheme Mehfil -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

**Without a Firebase config** the app runs in *device-only* mode: the welcome screen offers **Continue on this device**, data is stored as JSON in Application Support, and the whole product can be used and reviewed. Nothing else changes.

**With Firebase** — drop `GoogleService-Info.plist` (git-ignored) into `Mehfil/`. The build script registers the Google URL scheme from it, `FirebaseApp.configure()` runs, and the welcome screen shows Sign in with Apple and Google. Setup steps, Firestore rules and the data model are in [`mehfil-backend`](https://github.com/Sanu5/mehfil-backend).

## Ship it

- Bundle id `com.anish.mehfil`, iOS 26.0+, version in `MARKETING_VERSION` / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.
- Signing & Capabilities → your team. **Sign in with Apple** is in `Mehfil.entitlements`; Xcode registers it on the App ID.
- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` declares the collected data (email, name, user content — linked, not tracked) and the required-reason APIs; answer App Privacy the same way.
- Account deletion (guideline 5.1.1(v)) is in Profile → Account → Delete account: re-authenticates, revokes the Apple token, deletes every document, then the Firebase user.
- Privacy policy and terms: [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md), [`TERMS.md`](TERMS.md) — link them in App Store Connect.
- Archive with **Product → Archive** and upload through Xcode Organizer.

## Design notes worth knowing

- "Today" is live (`Cal.today`). The sample season is shifted by whole weeks so its busy Saturday is always the coming one — the conflict banner, overdue money and "Needs attention" read correctly on any date.
- Nothing derived is stored: overdue is computed from due dates, crew conflicts from bookings, payment state from milestones. Firestore rules (`mehfil-backend/firestore.rules`) allow only the owner to touch `vendors/{uid}`.
- Tokens come straight from the design's `tokens.css`: ground `#F6F9FC`, surface white, ink `#0D253D`, indigo `#533AFD`, ruby only for danger, and a dark set on ink/brand-navy with the accent lifted to subdued indigo for contrast.
- Decline on the change request is tertiary, not destructive; destructive confirmations name the exact thing being cancelled.
- The client page (E2) has no dark variant on purpose — it is the client's page, opened from a WhatsApp link.
